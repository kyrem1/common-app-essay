Upon finally understanding the ingenious proof of Cantorâ€™s theorem, I once again felt that familiar sense of wonder towards the giants whose shoulders I now recklessly aspire to stand upon. Always following this moment of reverence, I experience the ineffable pleasure of rightly viewing mathematical beauty.

I desire to become the shoulders that someday are stood upon to peer further into the unknown than I will and, while doing so, provide that same sense of wonder to all those figuratively standing above me.

Every lecture I was captivated by the sheer amount of thought required to stand doubtless in front of trivialities such as Euclidean Division and the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic, whose truth every grade schooler is conditioned to accept without contest.
